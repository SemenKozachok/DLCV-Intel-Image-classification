# DLCV Intel Image classification model

## What is it?
This is a small project aiming to create a model which can classify images of 6 different classes: forest, mountain, sea, glacier, buildings, street.

## How?
It uses the dataset [Intel image classification from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification). Different CNN models (pretrained as well as from-scratch ones) were trained and tuned on the dataset to obtain maximum accuracy.

## How to run:
1. Get the dataset from Kaggle, unzip it.
2. Choose the version of the model you want to test or change, open the corresponding .ipynb notebook.
3. Change the "ds_path" variable to your own path to the dataset.
4. (Optional)Change the structure of the CNN model (cell with class at the end of the notebook).
5. Run the notebook and get your own results.
